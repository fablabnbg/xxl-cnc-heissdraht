An inexpensive rotory table
---------------------------

This rotory table is designed to be sturdy, quite precise,
inexpensive and reproducable with a lasercutter.

Technical data
--------------

 Diameter:     290 mm
 Height:     ca 40 mm
 Max Speed:      6 RPM
 Max Force:   ca 1 Nm
 Speed/Position Control: Arduino compatible

Concept
------- 
 Material: Plywood (Birch Multiplex); Steel pins 2mm diameter.
 Motor:    Mini-Servo TowerPro 90 (modded for continuous rotation)
 Control:  Attiny2313, PWM input or RS232 input
 Center:   No axis. Allows for custom openings.
 Positioning: Magnetic index on Motor wheel, 18 Pulses per Revolution
 Total Cost: below 20 EUR

 All parts are cut from plywood. Several rings are cut in smaller segments
 to better use available area. The rotating top part is held down only by 
 its own weight and can be pulled upwards to open the rotary table.

 The top rests on six (wooden) wheels, and is centered by 3 pulleys, one of them driven by the servo. The pulleys have 18 teeth each and mesh inside 
 a ring of 234 teeth.
