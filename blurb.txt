Computer-Controlled Styrofoam Cutter
------------------------------------


The hot-wire foam cutter is a tool used to cut polystyrene foam and similar
materials. The device consists of a metal wire, which is heated via to a dark
red glow. As the wire is passed through the material, the heat from the wire
vaporises the material.

The depth of the cut is limited only by the wire length. Our machine is modular
and can be lengthend or shortened as needed. Airplane wings anybody?
Architecture, and landscape models also come to mind.

Built using motors and guides from a a 3D-Printer, this machine is a four
degree of freedom CNC system.
